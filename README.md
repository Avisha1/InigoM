# Cordova sample app - Weather app
Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova combines the goodness of your favorite IDE with the ease of creating apps for multiple mobile operating systems, all in a simple to use workflow. One of the major pain points for our enterprise developers is the effort required to build apps for multiple platforms, while keeping costs and effort down. Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova allows developers to use HTML5 and JavaScript, along with their favorite open source framework libraries to build web applications.

Leveraging the Apache Cordova framework, we create packaged mobile apps that feel and behave like native device applications. What's great is that all this can be done completely from within Visual Studio, with full tooling support for building, debugging and packaging that our customers love. Our highlight features include attaching and debugging to the Android emulator and devices, plus, being able to build and simulate remotely for the iOS platform.

The WeatherApp sample shows you a very basic app that gets the weather for any United States zip code. This app consumes the Geolocation plugin from Cordova to populate the search box with the zip code of the device's current location. This sample is built from the ground up in the article: [Get started with Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova](http://taco.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/get-started-first-mobile-app/).
